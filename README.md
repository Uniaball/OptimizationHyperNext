# About OPHN(OptimizationHyperN)
Compared to the author's other modpack, OptimizationHyper, this modpack **takes game performance to the extreme**. Through **in-depth optimization** and **streamlining of mods**, this modpack not only significantly improves the game's running efficiency but also greatly reduces memory usage and loading times. Specifically, this modpack achieves performance enhancement through the following methods:

1. **Optimized Resource Loading**: By improving the resource loading mechanism, it reduces unnecessary resource consumption.
2. **Reduced Number of Mods**: By decreasing the number of mods, it lowers the consumption of system resources.
3. **Enhanced Compatibility**: By adjusting the compatibility between mods, it minimizes potential conflicts and errors.

However, due to the use of fewer mods, this modpack will not include any **auxiliary mods** or **information display mods**.

Nevertheless, this modpack is still very suitable for players who pursue ultimate game performance, as they prioritize the smoothness and responsiveness of the game over auxiliary features.
